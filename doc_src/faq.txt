 * @section faq_no_population_iterator What if my population data structure doesn't provide iterators?
 *
 * Write one :-). <a

 * >Boost iterator adaptor</a> makes it really easy.
 *
 * However, keep in mind that pointers are indeed iterators. If your
 * population data structure guarantees to store elements
 * contiguously, and if you can get a pointer to the first element,
 * you have iterators already. See @ref trsl_example2.cpp "trsl_example2.cpp"
 * for an example with a C array.
