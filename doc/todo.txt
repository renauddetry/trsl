/** @defgroup todo To Do List

@section todo_short_term Short Term

- Add a module for boost::filter_iterator explaination (e.g. interoperability, constness, etc...).
- Add precise parameter requirements (e.g. sample size in [0,...])
- Document random_permutation_iterator.

@section todo_long_term Long Term

- Add debug stubs. One good thing to check for would be that
  is_picked_systematic doesn't return more elements than requested,
  and that it has returned the exact number of elements upon destruction.
  This will call for an extra bool <em>beenCalled</em> to prevent
  errors in temporary instantiations of is_picked_systematic.
- Add an iterator that combines permutation and systematic sampling.
