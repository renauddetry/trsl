/** @defgroup random Random Number Generators

Some of the classes in TRSL need random numbers. If a class needs only
one random number (e.g. trsl::is_picked_systematic), it is generally
possible to provide it directly. It's then up to the user
to take care of the random generator.

Another possibility is to use TRSL-internal random capabilities,
implemented using system random number generators. By default, the
<tt>rand</tt> function is used.

The <tt>rand</tt> generator that comes with BSD systems (including MacOS X) has some
issues &mdash; some bits of the returned numbers are not
usable. However, BSD systems provide a second, better random number
generator through a function named <tt>%random</tt>. This function
will be used instead of <tt>rand</tt> if
TRSL_USE_BSD_BETTER_RANDOM_GENERATORS is defined. Note that in Linux,
both <tt>rand</tt> and <tt>%random</tt> use the same generator.
