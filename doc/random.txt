/** @defgroup random Random Number Generators

Some of the classes in TRSL need random numbers. If a class need only
one random number (e.g. trsl::is_picked_systematic), it is generally
possible to provide that random number directly. It's then up to the user
to take care of the random generator/seed.

Another possibility is to use TRSL-internal random capabilities,
implemented using the system random number generator (the
<tt>random</tt> function).
