  /**
   * @brief Functor to use with persistent_filter_iterator for
   * systematic sampling of a range.
   *
   * The sampling method is systematic sampling [1, 2].
   *
   * This class is intended to be used as a predicate functor to
   * trsl::persistent_filter_iterator to form a <em>sample
   * iterator</em>. The sample iterator accesses a population of
   * elements through a range defined by a pair of Forward Iterators
   * (begin/end), and provides on-the-fly iteration through a sample
   * of the population.
   *
   * Systematic sampling may perform very badly if the order in which
   * the input population is presented is following a pattern. If a
   * pattern is likely to occur in the population, the user may want to
   * pipe the sample iterator <em>after</em> a
   * trsl::random_permutation_iterator, or use is_picked_systematic with
   * ppfilter_iterator.  The resulting iterator effectively implements
   * <em>probability sampling</em>.  The price to pay for probability
   * sampling is a <em>Random Access Iterator</em>. While
   * persistent_filter_iterator will work e.g. with <tt>std::list</tt>,
   * ppfilter_iterator requires e.g. <tt>std::vector</tt> or
   * <tt>std::deque</tt>.
   *
   * @param ElementType Type of the elements in the 
   * population. Constness and
   * reference modifiers are handled internally; this parameter should be
   * a bare type, e.g. <tt>Particle</tt> (<em>not</em> <tt>const Particle&</tt>).
   *
   * @param WeightType Element weight type, should be a floating point type.
   * Defaults to <tt>double</tt>.
   *
   * @param WeightAccessor Type of the accessor that will allow to
   * extract weights from elements.
   * See @ref accessor for further details on accessors.
