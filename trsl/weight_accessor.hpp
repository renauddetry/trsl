   *
   * This class is very similar to
   * <tt>std::const_mem_fun_ref_t</tt>. The only two differences are
   * <ul><li>mp_weight_accessor provides a default constructor that
   * initializes the method pointer to NULL;</li>
   * <li>mp_weight_accessor checks if the method pointer is NULL
   * before dereferencing it.</li></ul> These differences allow
   * mp_weight_accessor to be used as a default type for
   * is_picked_systematic weight accessor, since a default-value
   * initialization won't imply segfault. However, access is a bit
   * slower because of the extra check for a non-NULL pointer.  If the
   * pointer is NULL, <tt>operator()</tt> returns 1.
   *
   * See @ref accessor for more details.
